> See it live on [pklepa.github.io/weather-app](https://pklepa.github.io/weather-app/)

## Objectives

The focus and objectives of this project are the following:

- Query and process data from an external API ([OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))

- Better understand and apply knowledge on the Javascript _Promises_ concept

- Use ES6 syntax for Promises processing `async` and `await`

- Practice React development, applying concepts as Reusable Components, State, Props and Lifecycle of components.

- Make use of the modern React syntax of Hooks, as in useState() and useEffect()

- Further improve JSX proficiency

- Design of simple, clean and mobile-friendly landing page

## Development

### Javascript Framework

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### Libraries, extensions and tools

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter tool to standardize code
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting

## More information

- Made as a solution for the Weather App Project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Future works

Even though it is simple, this was a very fun project to work on. I'll list here a few features which i might add in the future:

- Change the default weather icons given by the api to some others more fitting to the overall design style. [These](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/free-weather-iconsets/) might be a good fit.

- Add a "More" button to display more information for the user, such as country, current time, min/max temperatures, humidity, etc...

- Change the input to be an [Algolia](https://community.algolia.com/places/) or [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete) powered autocomplete

- Hide API keys from Github

- Animate the input form up and down, depending whether the results page is showing or not

- Display error message to user when a fetch is failed (such as the case of non-existent city query)
